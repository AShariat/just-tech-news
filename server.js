// turn on connection to db and server. We use the sequelize.sync() method to establish the connection to the database. The "sync" part means that this is Sequelize taking the models and connecting them to associated database tables. If it doesn't find a table, it'll create it for you! The other thing to notice is the use of {force: false} in the .sync() method. This doesn't have to be included, but if it were set to true, it would drop and re-create all of the database tables on startup. This is great for when we make changes to the Sequelize models, as the database would need a way to understand that something has changed. This definition performs similarly to DROP TABLE IF EXISTS, which was used previously. This allows the table to be overwritten and re-created. By forcing the sync method to true, we will make the tables re-create if there are any association changes.
sequelize.sync({ force: false }).then(() => {
  app.listen(PORT, () => console.log("Now listening"));
});
